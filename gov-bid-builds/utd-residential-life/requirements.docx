## Access Control Model

The access control model is essential for ensuring that users have appropriate permissions based on their roles. This model will utilize Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to manage user permissions effectively.

### Roles and Permissions
| Role                  | Permissions                                                                 |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Residence Director     | View all data, manage user roles, approve proposals, generate reports      |
| Community Coordinator   | Log complaints, submit proposals, generate reports, view student data      |
| Student Staff          | Log complaints, view personal evaluations, access training materials        |
| IT Support Staff       | Manage system settings, access logs, troubleshoot issues                   |
| Upper Management       | View reports, access program metrics, manage budgets                       |
| Compliance Auditor     | Access audit logs, review compliance documentation                          |

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Define Roles**: Create a roles table in the database to store role definitions.
2. **Assign Permissions**: Create a permissions table to define what each role can do.
3. **User Role Assignment**: When a user is created, assign them a role based on their position.
4. **Middleware for Access Control**: Implement middleware in the application to check user permissions before allowing access to specific routes or actions.

### Example Middleware Implementation
```javascript
const checkPermissions = (requiredPermission) => {
  return (req, res, next) => {
    const userPermissions = req.user.permissions;
    if (userPermissions.includes(requiredPermission)) {
      return next();
    }
    return res.status(403).json({ message: 'Forbidden' });
  };
};
```
This middleware checks if the user has the required permission before proceeding with the request, ensuring that sensitive actions are protected.

## Onboarding & Activation Flow

The onboarding and activation flow is critical for ensuring that users can quickly and effectively start using the application. This section outlines the steps involved in onboarding new users and activating their accounts.

### Onboarding Steps
1. **User Registration**: Users fill out a registration form that includes their name, email, role, and institution.
2. **Email Verification**: Upon registration, an email is sent to the user with a verification link. The user must click the link to verify their email address.
3. **Account Activation**: After verification, the user is prompted to set a password and complete their profile.
4. **Role Assignment**: Based on the user’s role, they will receive tailored onboarding instructions and access to relevant features.
5. **Training Resources**: Users are provided with links to training materials, including video tutorials and documentation.

### Example Registration API Endpoint

Effective monitoring and alerting are crucial for maintaining the health of the application and ensuring that any issues are identified and addressed promptly. This section outlines the strategies and tools that will be used for monitoring the application.

### Monitoring Tools
The application will utilize a combination of monitoring tools to track performance, availability, and user behavior. Key tools include:

- **Prometheus**: For collecting and storing metrics from the application and infrastructure. Prometheus will be configured to scrape metrics from application endpoints and provide real-time insights into performance.
- **Grafana**: For visualizing metrics collected by Prometheus. Dashboards will be created to display key performance indicators (KPIs) such as response times, error rates, and resource utilization.
- **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)**: For centralized logging and analysis. Logs from all application components will be sent to Elasticsearch for storage and analysis, with Kibana providing a user-friendly interface for querying and visualizing logs.

### Alerting Strategies
Alerts will be configured to notify the DevOps team of any critical issues that may impact the application's performance or availability. The following alerting strategies will be implemented:

- **Threshold Alerts**: Alerts will be set up based on predefined thresholds for key metrics. For example, if the average response time exceeds 200 milliseconds for a sustained period, an alert will be triggered.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Implementing machine learning-based anomaly detection to identify unusual patterns in application behavior that may indicate underlying issues.

### Example Alert Configuration
The following is an example of how to configure an alert in Prometheus:
```yaml

# prometheus.yml
alerting:
  alertmanagers:
    - static_configs:
        - targets:
          - 'alertmanager:9093'

rule_files:
  - 'alerts.yml'

# alerts.yml
groups:
  - name: example_alerts
    rules:
      - alert: HighResponseTime
        expr: avg(rate(http_request_duration_seconds_sum[5m])) > 0.2
        for: 5m
        labels:
          severity: critical
        annotations:
          summary: 'High response time detected'
```

## Disaster Recovery

Disaster recovery (DR) planning is essential to ensure that the application can recover from catastrophic failures, such as data loss or infrastructure outages. This section outlines the strategies that will be implemented for disaster recovery.

### Backup Strategies
Regular backups of application data will be performed to ensure that data can be restored in the event of a failure. The following backup strategies will be employed:

- **Database Backups**: Automated backups of the database will be scheduled to occur daily. Backups will be stored in a secure location, such as AWS S3, with versioning enabled to allow for recovery from specific points in time.
- **File System Backups**: Regular backups of application files and configurations will be performed to ensure that the application can be restored in its entirety.

### Recovery Point Objective (RPO) and Recovery Time Objective (RTO)
The RPO and RTO will be defined to establish acceptable limits for data loss and downtime. The following objectives will be set:
- **RPO**: The maximum acceptable data loss will be set to 1 hour, meaning that backups will be taken at least every hour.
- **RTO**: The maximum acceptable downtime will be set to 2 hours, meaning that the application should be restored within this timeframe after a disaster.

### Disaster Recovery Testing
Regular testing of the disaster recovery plan will be conducted to ensure that it is effective and that the team is familiar with the recovery process. The following steps will be taken:
1. **Simulate a Disaster**: Conduct a simulation of a disaster scenario, such as a database failure or data corruption.
2. **Execute Recovery Procedures**: Follow the documented recovery procedures to restore the application and data.
3. **Evaluate Results**: Assess the effectiveness of the recovery process and identify any areas for improvement.

### Example Backup Configuration
The following is an example of how to configure automated backups for a PostgreSQL database:
```bash

# backup.sh
#!/bin/bash

# Set variables
DB_NAME=your_database
BACKUP_DIR=/path/to/backup

# Create a backup
pg_dump $DB_NAME > $BACKUP_DIR/backup_$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S).sql
```

## Accessibility Standards

Ensuring that the application is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities, is a fundamental requirement. This section outlines the accessibility standards that will be adhered to during the development of the application.

### Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)
The application will comply with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA standards. This includes:
- **Text Alternatives**: Providing text alternatives for non-text content, such as images and videos, to ensure that they can be understood by screen readers.
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Ensuring that all interactive elements can be accessed and operated using a keyboard, allowing users with mobility impairments to navigate the application.
- **Color Contrast**: Maintaining sufficient color contrast between text and background colors to ensure readability for users with visual impairments.

# Chapter 7: Technical Architecture & Data Model

## Service Architecture

The service architecture for this project is designed as a modular monolith, which allows for a single deployable unit while maintaining clear internal boundaries between different components. This approach simplifies deployment and scaling while ensuring that each module can be developed and maintained independently. The architecture will consist of the following key components:

1. **API Gateway**: The API Gateway will serve as the centralized entry point for all client requests. It will handle routing, authentication, and rate limiting. We will use Kong as our API Gateway, which provides robust features for managing API traffic.

2. **Microservices**: The application will be decomposed into several microservices, each responsible for a specific domain of functionality. These services will communicate with each other through a message queue, allowing for asynchronous processing and decoupling of components.

3. **Caching Layer**: A caching layer will be implemented using Redis to store frequently accessed data, reducing the load on the database and improving response times.

4. **Database per Service**: Each microservice will have its own isolated database, allowing for independent scaling and maintenance. This will also help in adhering to the principles of data encapsulation and service autonomy.

5. **Background Jobs**: Long-running tasks will be processed asynchronously using a background job system. We will utilize a worker queue with RabbitMQ to manage these tasks efficiently.

6. **Event-Driven Architecture**: An event bus will be implemented to facilitate communication between services. This will allow services to publish and subscribe to events, promoting a decoupled architecture.

### CLI Commands
To set up the development environment, the following CLI commands will be executed:

```bash

# Navigate to the project root
cd project-root/

# Build and start all services using Docker Compose
docker-compose up --build

# Run tests for a specific service
cd services/user-service/
npm test
```

## Database Schema

The database schema will be designed to support the core functionalities of the application. Each microservice will have its own database schema tailored to its specific needs. Below are the schemas for the three primary services:

### User Service Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    role VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Complaint Service Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE complaints (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT REFERENCES users(id),
    description TEXT NOT NULL,
    status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'Pending',
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Report Service Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE reports (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT REFERENCES users(id),
    report_data JSONB NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Data Relationships
- **Users** can submit multiple **Complaints**.
- **Users** can generate multiple **Reports**.

## API Design

The API will be designed following RESTful principles, providing endpoints for each of the core functionalities. Below are the key API endpoints for each service:

### User Service API
- **POST /api/users**: Create a new user.
- **GET /api/users/{id}**: Retrieve user details.
- **PUT /api/users/{id}**: Update user information.
- **DELETE /api/users/{id}**: Delete a user.

### Complaint Service API
- **POST /api/complaints**: Submit a new complaint.
- **GET /api/complaints/{id}**: Retrieve complaint details.
- **PUT /api/complaints/{id}**: Update complaint status.
- **DELETE /api/complaints/{id}**: Delete a complaint.

### Report Service API
- **POST /api/reports**: Generate a new report.
- **GET /api/reports/{id}**: Retrieve report details.
- **GET /api/reports/user/{userId}**: Retrieve all reports for a user.

### API Response Structure
All API responses will follow a consistent structure:
```json
{
    "status": "success",
    "data": { ... },
    "message": "Operation completed successfully"
}
```

### Error Handling Strategies
Error handling will be implemented at both the API and service levels. Each service will return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages. The following error codes will be used:
- **400 Bad Request**: Invalid input data.
- **401 Unauthorized**: Authentication failed.
- **403 Forbidden**: Insufficient permissions.
- **404 Not Found**: Resource not found.
- **500 Internal Server Error**: Unexpected server error.

For example, if a user attempts to submit a complaint without providing a description, the API will respond with:
```json
{
    "status": "error",
    "message": "Description is required"
}
```

# Chapter 8: Security & Compliance

> **Chapter purpose**: This chapter provides the design intent and implementation guidance for Security & Compliance. The first step is understanding the inputs and outputs, then identifying dependencies and prerequisites before implementation.

# Chapter 8: Security & Compliance

Security and compliance are paramount in the development of this application, particularly given the sensitive nature of student data. The software must adhere to TX-RAMP and SOC2 Type II standards, ensuring that all data handling processes comply with industry best practices. Essential security measures will include role-based access control, which will restrict user permissions based on defined roles, and audit logging to maintain an immutable record of data access and modifications. Additionally, data encryption protocols will be implemented to safeguard information both in transit and at rest. Regular security assessments and compliance audits will be conducted to identify vulnerabilities and ensure adherence to established guidelines.

## Authentication & Authorization

### Overview
Authentication and authorization are critical components of the security architecture for this application. The goal is to ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive data and perform actions based on their roles. This section outlines the implementation of role-based access control (RBAC) and single sign-on (SSO) integration.

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
RBAC will be implemented to manage user permissions effectively. The following roles will be defined:
- **Admin**: Full access to all features and settings.
- **Staff**: Access to log complaints, submit proposals, and generate reports.
- **Viewer**: Read-only access to reports and dashboards.

#### Implementation Steps
1. **Define Roles**: Create a configuration file to define roles and permissions.
   - **File**: `config/roles.json`
   ```json
   {
     "roles": {
       "admin": {
         "permissions": ["*"]
       },
       "staff": {
         "permissions": ["log_complaints", "submit_proposals", "generate_reports"]
       },
       "viewer": {
         "permissions": ["view_reports"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```
2. **Middleware for Authorization**: Implement middleware to check user permissions before accessing routes.
   - **File**: `middleware/auth.js`
   ```javascript
   const roles = require('../config/roles.json');

   function authorize(roleRequired) {
     return (req, res, next) => {
       const userRole = req.user.role;
       if (roles[userRole].permissions.includes(roleRequired) || roles[userRole].permissions.includes('*')) {
         return next();
       }
       return res.status(403).json({ message: 'Forbidden' });
     };
   }
   module.exports = authorize;
   ```
3. **Protect Routes**: Use the middleware to protect specific routes.
   - **File**: `routes/complaints.js`
   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const authorize = require('../middleware/auth');
   const router = express.Router();

   router.post('/', authorize('log_complaints'), (req, res) => {
     // Logic to log a complaint
   });

   module.exports = router;
   ```

### Single Sign-On (SSO) Integration
To enhance user experience and security, SSO will be integrated using SAML or OpenID Connect. This allows users to authenticate once and gain access to multiple applications.

#### Implementation Steps
1. **Choose an SSO Provider**: Select an SSO provider that supports SAML or OpenID Connect, such as Auth0 or Okta.
2. **Configure SSO**: Set up the SSO provider with the necessary redirect URIs and application settings.
3. **Implement SSO in Application**: Use libraries such as `passport-saml` or `passport-openidconnect` to handle authentication.
   - **File**: `middleware/sso.js`
   ```javascript
   const passport = require('passport');
   const SamlStrategy = require('passport-saml').Strategy;

   passport.use(new SamlStrategy({
     path: '/login/callback',
     entryPoint: 'https://sso-provider.com/saml',
     issuer: 'your-app'
   }, (profile, done) => {
     // Logic to find or create user
     done(null, user);
   }));
   ```
4. **Protect Routes with SSO**: Ensure that routes requiring authentication are protected by the SSO middleware.
   - **File**: `routes/dashboard.js`
   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const passport = require('passport');
   const router = express.Router();

   router.get('/', passport.authenticate('saml', { failureRedirect: '/login' }), (req, res) => {
     res.render('dashboard');
   });

   module.exports = router;
   ```

### Environment Variables
To manage sensitive information, environment variables will be used. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```plaintext
SAML_ENTRY_POINT=https://sso-provider.com/saml
SAML_ISSUER=your-app
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
```

## Data Privacy & Encryption

### Overview
Data privacy and encryption are essential for protecting sensitive student information. This section outlines the strategies for data encryption in transit and at rest, as well as compliance with data privacy regulations.

### Data Encryption in Transit
To protect data transmitted between clients and servers, HTTPS will be enforced using SSL/TLS certificates. The following steps will be taken:
1. **Obtain SSL Certificate**: Use a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) to obtain an SSL certificate.
2. **Configure Web Server**: Update the web server configuration to enforce HTTPS.
   - **File**: `nginx.conf`
   ```nginx
   server {
       listen 443 ssl;
       server_name your-domain.com;
       ssl_certificate /path/to/certificate.crt;
       ssl_certificate_key /path/to/private.key;

       location / {
           proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
       }
   }
   ```
3. **Redirect HTTP to HTTPS**: Ensure that all HTTP traffic is redirected to HTTPS.
   - **File**: `nginx.conf`
   ```nginx
   server {
       listen 80;
       server_name your-domain.com;
       return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
   }
   ```

### Data Encryption at Rest
To protect sensitive data stored in the database, encryption will be applied to specific fields, such as student names and identification numbers. The following steps will be taken:
1. **Choose an Encryption Library**: Use a library such as `crypto` in Node.js for encryption.
2. **Encrypt Data Before Storing**: Implement encryption logic in the data access layer.
   - **File**: `models/student.js`
   ```javascript
   const crypto = require('crypto');
   const algorithm = 'aes-256-cbc';
   const key = process.env.ENCRYPTION_KEY;
   const iv = crypto.randomBytes(16);

   function encrypt(text) {
     let cipher = crypto.createCipheriv(algorithm, Buffer.from(key), iv);
     let encrypted = cipher.update(text);
     encrypted = Buffer.concat([encrypted, cipher.final()]);
     return iv.toString('hex') + ':' + encrypted.toString('hex');
   }

   function decrypt(text) {
     let textParts = text.split(':');
     let iv = Buffer.from(textParts.shift(), 'hex');
     let encryptedText = Buffer.from(textParts.join(':'), 'hex');
     let decipher = crypto.createDecipheriv(algorithm, Buffer.from(key), iv);
     let decrypted = decipher.update(encryptedText);
     decrypted = Buffer.concat([decrypted, decipher.final()]);
     return decrypted.toString();
   }
   ```
3. **Store Encrypted Data**: Ensure that only encrypted data is stored in the database.
   - **File**: `controllers/studentController.js`
   ```javascript
   const Student = require('../models/student');

   async function createStudent(req, res) {
     const encryptedName = encrypt(req.body.name);
     const student = new Student({ name: encryptedName, ... });
     await student.save();
     res.status(201).json(student);
   }
   ```

### Compliance with Data Privacy Regulations
Compliance with data privacy regulations such as FERPA and GDPR is crucial. The following strategies will be implemented:
1. **Data Minimization**: Collect only the data necessary for functionality.
2. **User Consent**: Obtain explicit consent from users before collecting personal data.
3. **Data Access Controls**: Implement strict access controls to limit who can view or modify sensitive data.
4. **Regular Audits**: Conduct regular audits to ensure compliance with data privacy regulations.

## Security Architecture

### Overview
The security architecture of the application is designed to protect against various threats while ensuring compliance with TX-RAMP and SOC2 Type II standards. This section outlines the key components of the security architecture, including network security, application security, and incident response.

### Network Security
1. **Firewalls**: Implement firewalls to protect the application from unauthorized access. Configure rules to allow only necessary traffic.
   - **File**: `firewall-rules.sh`
   ```bash
   # Allow HTTP and HTTPS traffic
   sudo ufw allow 80/tcp
   sudo ufw allow 443/tcp
   # Deny all other traffic
   sudo ufw default deny
