/**
 * seedComponentAuthoring — applies AUTHORED config (generation prompt, thumbnail,
 * visual identity, Parts, and I/O contracts) on top of the base curriculum-type
 * registry. The registry (typeRegistry.ts / typeSeeder) creates the rows with
 * behavior defaults; this seed layers the human-authored experience on top.
 *
 * Idempotent: keyed on slug, re-runnable, updates in place, never inserts a
 * duplicate. Run AFTER the base type seed. Rows that don't exist yet are reported
 * as `missing` (not created) so a typo never silently spawns a new type.
 * `renderers` merges KEY-WISE, so authoring one surface never wipes the other seven.
 *
 * As types are certified in Experience Studio (see the `build-curriculum-type`
 * skill), add their authored fields to COMPONENT_AUTHORING so the config survives
 * a reseed and promotes cleanly to prod.
