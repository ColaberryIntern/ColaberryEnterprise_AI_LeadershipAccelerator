# Directives

Human-readable Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for the Colaberry Enterprise AI Leadership Accelerator.

Directives define **what** the system should do — goals, inputs, outputs, edge cases, safety constraints, and verification expectations. They are living documents that must be updated as the system evolves.

Per the project's governance model (CLAUDE.md Layer 1), directives guide orchestration, execution, and verification layers.
